bbPress doesn't provide very intuitive Statistics functionality, with this plugin we aimed on improving that.

== Description ==

With bbPress Advanced Statistics, webmasters will be able to easily plonk an awesome shortcode on their forum - and it will immediately come to life showing off the forum statistics. 

== Installation ==

Installing "bbPress Advanced Statistics" can be done either by searching for "bbPress Advanced Statistics" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is bbPress a requirement for this plugin? =

Yes, absolutely. 

= Does this work for previously logged in users? =

Unfortunately, WordPress nor bbPress provide a "user is online" functionality out of the box - we had to add that ourselves, thus - data will only be displayed in this plugin after it has been installed as users log in to your site.
